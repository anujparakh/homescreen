## Required Files

Place your 5 images with the following filenames:
- `sourced-1.jpg`
- `sourced-2.jpg`

- `sourced-4.jpg`
- `sourced-5.jpg`

## Image Specifications

- **Format:** JPEG (optimized for web)
- **Resolution:** 4K quality recommended
- **File size:** No limit (can be large files)
- **Total:** Exactly 5 images
